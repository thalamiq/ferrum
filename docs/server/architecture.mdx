## High-Level Architecture

**Conceptual view**

- Stateless API nodes handle FHIR requests
- Background workers process asynchronous and long-running tasks
- PostgreSQL acts as the single system of record
- An Admin UI provides operational visibility

---

## Runtime Components

### API Server

The API server exposes the FHIR REST interface.

- Handles validation, authorization, and request processing
- Implements CRUD, search, batch, transaction, and operation endpoints
- Stateless and horizontally scalable

### Background Workers

Background workers execute work that should not block HTTP requests.

- Search indexing
- Terminology expansion
- Bulk and long-running operations
- Package installation and maintenance

Workers can be scaled independently from the API.

### Database

PostgreSQL is the **only persistent datastore**.

It stores:

- FHIR resources and full version history
- Search indexes
- Background jobs
- Installed FHIR packages and metadata

This design avoids hidden state and simplifies backup and recovery.

### Admin UI

A web-based interface for operators and administrators.

- Browse and inspect resources
- Monitor background jobs
- Inspect indexing and terminology status
- Troubleshoot server behavior

## Example Request Flow

**Posting a transaction**

1. A client sends a FHIR [`Transaction`](/api-reference/batch/transaction) bundle to the API
2. The server validates the bundle and applies FHIR [transaction rules](https://build.fhir.org/http.html#trules)
3. The resources are stored in a database transaction
4. Indexing work gets queued for background processing
5. The client gets an immediate response
